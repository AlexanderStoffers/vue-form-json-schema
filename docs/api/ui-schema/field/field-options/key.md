# key

> The key special attribute is primarily used as a hint for Vueâ€™s virtual DOM algorithm to identify VNodes when diffing the new list of nodes against the old list. - [Vue.js guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#key)

vue-form-json-schema adds keys to fields automatically. There is no need to set this property.
