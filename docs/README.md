# Vue Form JSON Schema

A [JSON schema](json-schema.org) based form generator without any fields!

`vue-form-json-schema` tries to not make any assumptions about how your form is structured. It doesn't give you **any prebuilt components** for you to puzzle your form together with. Instead you can use any Vue component or HTML element in your form.

Any HTML element or Vue component which can emit an event can be used with this form generator.
